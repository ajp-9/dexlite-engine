# Dexlite-Engine
A 3D OpenGL game engine written in C++, and created by me.

## How to Build:
#### Windows:
Using Visual Studio 2019 & Premake, it should be very easy to run the batch file (.bat) in the scripts folder to run the premake5 builder.  
After that you should be able to open the solution and compile without issue.  

#### MacOS:
Somewhat supported.

#### Linux:
Somewhat supported.

## Documentation:
The link to the wiki is here: https://github.com/ajp-9/dexlite-engine/wiki  
There isn't much in it currently but after I get this engine to a stable and decent state I will begin to work on the wiki

## Future Plans:
- [x] Basic application.
- [x] Integrating a simple logging library (spdlog).
- [x] Layer system.
- [x] Basic 3D Rendering.
- [x] ImGUI integration.
- [x] Input system.
- [x] Integrating EnTT with scenes & components.
- [x] A basic material system.
- [x] Model loading.
- [x] A simple heirarchy & transform inheritance system to the ECS.
- [x] Mac & Linux support.
- [x] Basic lighting system.
- [x] Framebuffers.
- [ ] Making an scene editor.
- [ ] Integrating a physics engine.
- [ ] More advanced lighting, ex: shadows.
- [ ] Basic animation.
- [ ] Audio system.
- [ ] A simple skinnable GUI system built ontop of ImGUI.
- [ ] Adding Documentation.
- [ ] Possibly adding scripting.
- [ ] Game ready.

## Contribution 
If you find a bug, or just something that needs to be fixed, please do make an issue or a pull request.  
For now though keep in mind that this engine is going through a LOT of work and what you see one day will probably not be the same a few days or week later.
