# Dexterous-Engine
The goal of this engine is to be able to work fast and efficiently on lower quality computers and smaller electronics. The engine was made in mind with the fact that you need to interact natively with the engine for maximum performance. This engine isn't something that is necessarily aiming for ultra fancy graphics, this is meant to deliver decent graphics and gameplay on weaker machines like phones and tablets. (and also I'm not that interested in this project taking years to finish, since this is pretty much just a hobby)

## How to Build:
As long as you're on Windows and use Visual Studio 2019 it should be very easy to run the batch file (.bat) in the scripts folder to run the premake5 builder.  
After that you should be able to open the solution compile without issue.  
For Mac, well.. uh.. have fun =p

## Documentation:
The link to the wiki is here: https://github.com/ajp-9/dexterous-engine/wiki  
There isn't much in it currently but after I get this engine to a stable and decent state I will begin to work on the wiki

## Future Plans:
* Adding a simple material system
* Model loading
* Integrating a physics engine
* Making an editor
* Adding Documentation

## Contribution 
If you find a bug, or just something that needs to be fixed, please do make an issue or pull request.  
For now though keep in mind that this engine is going through a LOT of work and what you see one day will probably not be the same a few days or week later.
